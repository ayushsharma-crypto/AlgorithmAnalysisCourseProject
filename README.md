# alGOT - Game of Algorithms


# What is this project about?

This project takes a shot at choosing algorithms of different territories and attempts at teaching the end user what a particular algorithm is all about. There are two sections to each algorithm, a presentation explaining the use case of an algorithm in a story/scenario and an implementation of each algorithm in python3 using visual means as well.

## Algorithms covered
1. Minimax Algorithm
2. An algorithm which uses graph to detect the guilty person in a given crime scene
3. MST Algorithm (Kruskal Implementation)
4. LZW Compression Algorithm
5. Face Recognition ML Algorithm


## Other details
All of the program is compiled in the form of an interactive shell script, instructions to run which are given in the repository. The instructions file also contains all the packages which needs to be installed along with other basic instructions.
